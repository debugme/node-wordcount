npm start fails on windows because you are using unix commands
code needs more tests esp. around files larger than 1GB
code needs to be refactored into a production-ready form e.g. namespaced in class/object perhaps

you should employ strategy pattern to decide whether to calculate primes or use a table, as each has different tradeoffs
